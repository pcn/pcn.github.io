      Until I can find a way to do this in some way that's prettier,
      I'm going to be doing this in circa-1998 html.
    <h2>5/6/2015</h2>
    <p/>
      Today I've been playing with creating a somewhat workable
      docker/container environment.  I've been reading a whole lot of
      material about how to setup docker.
      <br>
      I'm doing this to support a small test system that I want to grow.
    <p/>
      Phase 1: Install containers for the head version of antirez/disque.
      <br>
      Doing this gives me a service that I can easily read/write to,
      which is simple, but which doesn't have a whole lot of convetion
      build up around it from other contributors.  This lets me make all
      of my own mistakes.
      <br>
      The first part of the project is to create a 3-node consul
      service.  Once that service is established, my hope is to build
      other experiments around it.
    <p>
      To allow for discovery, each VM that's running disque will run
      consul, regstrator, and I don't know, something else.
      <br>
      Other things to run here:
      <ul>
        <li> Salt deployments of services
        <li> Use runit to start and run containers that provide services.
        <li> Template runit services
        <li> Use consul/registrators registrations within to configure services
      </ul>
